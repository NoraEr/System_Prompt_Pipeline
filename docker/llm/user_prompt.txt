Summarise the following text below by extracting three main important statements:
Hydrogen is a potential energy solution for harder to electrify areas like parts of industry, heavier 
transport such as aviation and shipping, and potentially heating buildings, as well as the important role it 
can play in the power sector. Our ambition to have up to 10GW of low carbon hydrogen production 
capacity by 2030 could generate enough clean electricity to power all of London for a year. Today, we 
are confirming the first winning projects from the £240 million Net Zero Hydrogen Fund. We are 
announcing a shortlist of projects for due diligence in the first electrolytic hydrogen allocation round, 
through which we intend to support up to 250MW of new electrolytic hydrogen production capacity, 
subject to affordability and value for money. Successful projects in this round will be funded by 
government until the hydrogen levy is in place. Further, we are announcing our intention to launch a 
second electrolytic allocation round later this year, through which we intend to support up to 750MW 
capacity, and to publish a hydrogen production delivery roadmap by the end of the year. The first and
second allocation rounds are intended to support our ambition of up to 1 GW of electrolytic hydrogen in 
operation or construction by the end of 2025. We are also naming the CCUS-enabled hydrogen projects 
moving forward on the Track-1 clusters, intended to support our ambition for up to 1GW of CCUSenabled hydrogen in operation or construction by the end of 2025. To bring forward hydrogen transport 
and storage infrastructure business models, we are also aiming to introduce legislative powers when 
parliamentary time allows, which will be crucial to designing these new business models by 2025. These 
actions are key to potentially unlocking up to £11 billion in private investment by 2030, accelerating the 
UK hydrogen economy to bolster energy security and potentially supporting over 12,000 jobs by 2030.
